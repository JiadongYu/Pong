# Pong
Recreated the hit arcade game pong using Python's turtle library and OOP
This project utilises 3 different classes - scoreboard, paddle and ball
The scoreboard class is responsible for updating the points of each player
The paddle class controls the movement of the paddle
The ball class controls the movement of the ping pong ball and its interactions with the play area and the paddle
